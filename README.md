An ordinary Python library is Tkinter. The quickest and simplest approach to create an object-oriented GUI application is with Python and the tkinter package.

It offers us a number of standard GUI (graphical user interface) building blocks, such as buttons, menus, and other types of entry fields and display regions, that we may utilise to create our user interfaces.

Some of the common widgets used in Tkinter are :

1. Frame : serves as a holding area for other widgets and serves as a container.
2. Text : It enables us to display and alter text in a variety of styles and offers a prepared text display.
3. Label : Used to display text and images, but we are unable to interact with it.
4. Button : Often used add buttons and we may add functions and methods to it.
5. Entry : One-line string text can be entered into this widget.
6. Labelframe : For intricate window layouts, this widget serves as a separator or container.
7. Listbox : It just has text elements, all of which are the same colour and font.
8. Scrollbar: This gives a sliding controller.
9. Canvas : Custom widgets can be implemented using the canvas widget.
10. Scale : This widget offers graphical slider items that let us choose different scale values.
Radiobutton : Use a radio button to carry out one of several choices.
Checkbox : Use a checkbox to implement on-off choices.
Listbox : It just has text elements, all of which are the same colour and font.


How to start making a simple registration form using Tkinter :
Step 1 : The first step is to import the tkinter module (using either tkinter import * or just import tkinter).
Step 2 : The primary window of the GUI programme was created.
Step 3 : Include one or more widgets in the GUI programme (controls such as buttons, labels, and text boxes, etc.).
Step 4 : Enter the primary events to react to each event that the user has triggered.
